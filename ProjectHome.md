# P1906.1 - Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework #

A common framework greatly aids in developing useful simulators for nanoscale communication. This includes interconnecting systems of multiple types of nanoscale simulators. A common abstract model enables theoretical progress to proceed from different disciplines with a common language. This framework serves as a recommended practice for additional nanoscale networking standards as industry becomes more involved.This recommended practice contains a conceptual model and a standard terminology for ad hoc network communication at the nanoscale. This recommended practice also contains: (1) a definition of nanoscale networking (2) a conceptual model for ad hoc nanoscale networking (3) common terminology for nanoscale networking, including: (a) a definition of a nanoscale channel highlighting the fundamental differences from a macroscale channel (b) abstract nanoscale channel interfaces with nanoscale systems (c) performance metrics common to ad hoc nanoscale communication networks (d) a mapping between nanoscale and traditional communication networks, including necessary high level components such as a map of major components: coding and packets, addressing, routing, localization, layering, reliability.


## The ieee-p1906-1-reference-code project represents the reference code modeling the communication framework conceived within the IEEE P1906.1 working group. ##
